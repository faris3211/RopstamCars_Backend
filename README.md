<h1 align="center">Welcome to RopstamCars Backend ðŸ‘‹</h1>

> It is the backend part of an assessment project from ropstam solutions for the MERN developer position. After carefully understanding the requirements, I have assumed the context about the type of project i.e., a cars marketplace where users can create and login to their accounts and register the cars which are open to buy. I have also given a name to this project as RopstamCars and created a logo which suites the name. To run this backend part locally to test the APIs, just extract the zip folder, install the dependencies, and run the project using below mentioned commands. Here, important points to mention that you must have node js installed locally in your system to provide the run time environment to this backend of RopstamCars and in the .env file provide your own credentials as values to respective environment variables. In case of any query, feel free to contact me at muhammad.faris3601@gmail.com.
